# Peach Application Development

## Overview

This is the basic scaffolding for a PeachWorks app built in Angular 1.5.x. 

## Initial Setup

Clone this repository and name it according to the app key you set up in PeachWorks Foundations (```peach_APPKEY```)

Refer [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/peach-cli) for details on how to use the Peach CLI tool

```
$ npm install -g peach-cli
$ npm install
```


## ESLint

There are a series of rules built into peach-cli for code standards.  To override the rules to conform to your own teams standards, update your .eslintrc file based off the documentation [here](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)
